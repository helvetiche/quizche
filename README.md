## 🤔 common questions

**is it really free?**
yes! we're free to start. you can create flashcards and quizzes without paying anything.

**how accurate is the AI?**
pretty damn accurate. it uses Google's Gemini AI, which is one of the best. but always review what it generates - AI isn't perfect.

**can I edit AI-generated content?**
absolutely! edit questions, answers, flashcards - whatever you want. the AI is a starting point, not the final word.

**does it work with any PDF?**
works best with text-based PDFs (like typed documents). scanned images might not work as well.

**is my data safe?**
yes. we use Google's security systems. your PDFs and quizzes are private. teachers can only see their students' data.

**can students cheat?**
we track suspicious behavior, but we're not Big Brother. the system flags weird patterns, but teachers make the final call.

**how many flashcards can I create?**
as many as you want! no limits on flashcard creation.

**how many quizzes can teachers create?**
teachers can generate 3 quizzes per hour (to prevent abuse). after that, wait an hour or create quizzes manually.

**can I use it on my phone?**
yep! works on any device with a web browser.

**do I need to download anything?**
nope. it's all web-based. just go to the website and sign in.
